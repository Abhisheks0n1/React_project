First, set up the project environment by initializing it with npm init and installing the necessary dependencies like React and React-DOM. Next, create the main components: a Nav component for navigation and a User component to display GitHub user data. For fetching user data, integrate the GitHub API to get information such as the username, age, bio, and avatar image. Optionally, you can integrate the pdfjs-dist library if you plan to implement a PDF preview feature. After that, add basic styling to your components, either using inline styles or external CSS files, ensuring that everything is responsive. Then, set up a development server so you can run the project locally with the command npm run dev, and make sure your development environment is properly configured. Finally, you can add additional features, like dark mode, search functionality, or pagination, depending on your project needs.
